# Graph_Builder

Simple Qt project

`It is Alpha test and product is raw, it doesn't ready for release :D`

## How it works?

(i will do .exe format later...) (maybe) (probably never)

Write function that depends on x, Samples: sin(x) , x^2 etc. Then press `Build!` button and see what it does. 

## Available Functions

`(), +, -, *, /, ^, ln, sin, cos, tg, sqrt`
